<p>(Samantha&#8217;s kitchen, Samantha standing by a big churn looking very
tired. Josiah sitting by the table reading a newspaper with great interest).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> I&#8217;ve been churnin&#8217; on this cream for two full hours,
ever since I finished white-washin&#8217; the back kitchen, and ironin&#8217; and
moppin&#8217; and bakin&#8217;; I&#8217;m all beat out and I wish you&#8217;d help me a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Not lookin&#8217; up from his paper). I would love to Samantha,
nothin&#8217; pleases me more than to churn two or three pails full
of cream. Men had always ruther do that than to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> Take holt then and let me rest a minute. I did a big
day&#8217;s work before I begun to churn, and I&#8217;m tired out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Still reading). I would in a minute, Samantha, but if I
take this tub of butter to Jonesville I&#8217;ve got to grease the democrat,
it don&#8217;t run good. (Lookin&#8217; up from his paper). I want you to hear
this Samantha. Here is eloquence and good horse sense, I feel that I
love the man that wrote it&mdash;love him like a brother. You know I always
contended that wimmen wuz too weak and helpless to vote, even if
they knew enough, which they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>(Samantha stretches up her weary form and leans on the churn dasher
and says). Yes, I know you always argyed that way, but what is
the piece, Josiah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Oh, he is answerin&#8217; a Woman&#8217;s Sufferage argument. He
sez the idee of a great strong man allowin&#8217; a weak and delicate woman
to vote or endure any other hardship is perfectly obnoxious and repugnant
to any man that has the sperit of a man. The very idee of
lettin&#8217; them angels strain themselves liftin&#8217; at the political pole is more
than a tender-hearted man can endure. And he goes on to say, If I
were a woman I would do nothin&#8217; important, I would emulate the rose
and its wisdom, I would allure and charm and be silent. Man wuz made
to protect woman, to work for her, and vote for her. Woman wuz
made to smile on man and charm him in his hours of ease. Do you
hear that, Samantha? That masterly, convincin&#8217; logick?</p>

<p>(Samantha has resumed her churning again and says). Yes, I
hear it, Josiah. But I want a pail of cold water; you know I have to
draw it up by hand since the pump broke, and git a ten quart pail of
water on the end of the pole, I don&#8217;t believe the political pole would
draw much harder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Yes it would, Samantha; I guess you&#8217;d find it drawed
harder, wimmen little know the awful tuckerin&#8217; work it is to vote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> Well, I&#8217;d like a pail of water, Josiah, and I wish you&#8217;d
come and help me churn a little; seems as if my back will break off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> I told you, Samantha, I&#8217;d got to grease that democrat!
But what do you think of this beautiful article?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> The man goes too fur, Josiah, he hain&#8217;t megum
enough, wimmen hain&#8217;t angels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> They be angels; I always said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> And I always said they wuzn&#8217;t. And I always said
that wimmen did harder work than to vote and men never seemed to
worry about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Solemnly). No they don&#8217;t do any harder work, Samantha,
votin&#8217; wears on us strong minded men turribly, and what would it
do to a weak, fraguile woman? Oh that man puts men and wimmen in
their different spears so beautiful and so plain that it seems as if a
infant babe, or even a woman, could understand it. (Josiah steps nearer
to Samantha and points to the piece in the paper). If you&#8217;d foller
this man&#8217;s idees, Samantha, I&#8217;d be the happiest man in Jonesville or
the world. (He sits down, leans back with his fingers in the arm-holes
of his vest in a very important attitude).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Reasonably). I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; to charm you, Josiah
but I don&#8217;t see how I could allure and charm and do my house work at
the same time. And even if I wuz to do the Rose Act when I have a big
churnin&#8217; to do I don&#8217;t see how it would affect you, for you always have
to grease the democrat or the sarah, or ile harnesses churnin&#8217; days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (In a cross tone). What of it? What if I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> Oh don&#8217;t git agitated, Josiah, this butter has got to
be churned and worked over, and the rest of my mornin&#8217;s work done,
and I wish you&#8217;d pull up a pole of water, and help finish the churnin&#8217;
and bring up that tub from the suller and help pack it. It is hard
work for a woman&#8217;s back and arms when they&#8217;re most broke already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Rising and speaking very cross). If I go to Jonesville that
democrat has got to be greased. How can you expect a democrat to run
without ilein&#8217;? And sometimes they won&#8217;t run then. (He glances at Bryan&#8217;s
picture, hanging on the wall, grabs up his basin of wagon grease,
and starts off almost on the run and slams the door behind him.)</p>

<p>(Samantha stands a minute looking after him as if in deep thought,
and then she drops the butter dasher down with a bang, and sets the
churn back and says, speaking to herself). If I&#8217;m a angel I&#8217;ll stop
churnin&#8217; long enough to breathe, and if I&#8217;m too weak and delicate to drop
a slip of paper in a box once a year I&#8217;ll set down before I drop down.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACT II.</h2></div>


<p>(Samantha&#8217;s parlor, books, easy chairs, pictures, a high backed
rocker covered with cretonne, placed so its occupant can see through
the open door into the kitchen. Samantha is dressed in dark gingham
with white collar and cuffs and white bib apron, she is arranging some
books on the table and talking to herself.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> Josiah wants the Rose Act and he shall have it, I don&#8217;t
know exactly how to perform it without rules. I know roses blow out,
but it can&#8217;t be men want that, they&#8217;re deadly opposed to their pardners
talkin&#8217; on duty, which they call &#8220;blowin&#8217; round.&#8221; (She steps forward in
front of rocker and looks thoughtful). I guess it means to keep still and
look pretty. (Looks up satisfied). I will try faithful to do it right, I&#8217;m
always very thorough in anything I undertake. I believe that to allure and
charm I must be in a settin&#8217; poster. (Sits down in rocker). I believe I ort
to clasp my hands in a easy, graceful attitude. (Clasps her hands across
her waist). And to look winsome I must smile some. (Smiles a good deal).</p>

<p>(Josiah enters kitchen with his basin of wagon grease in his hand.
He glances at the churn and says). Gracious heavens! hain&#8217;t that butter
finished? Nor the tea-kettle on at half-past leven! (Glances into
the parlor). What is the matter? (Steps inside of door). What is
the matter, Samantha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Smiles sweetly. Josiah yells). Why in the name of
the gracious Peter hain&#8217;t dinner under way?</p>

<p>(Samantha smiles).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Steps close to her). What are you tryin&#8217; to do anyway,
Samantha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Calmly and firmly). I&#8217;m bein&#8217; winsome, Josiah, and
tryin&#8217; to allure and charm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> You&#8217;re bein&#8217; a gol-darned fool, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re a-bein&#8217;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Smiling, murmurs gently). Sweet pet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Stamps his feet in anger and yells). Sweet pet! Dum
foolishness! I shall lose the chance to sell that butter! And I&#8217;m starved!!!
(Flings himself around). Twenty-four hours since I eat a mouful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Sweetly). Men are made to work for wimmen, dearest
one. Them angels hain&#8217;t made for work, or votin&#8217;, or any other hardship.
(Sweetly and smilingly). The cream is all ready for you to
finish churnin&#8217;. The chicken to brile is in the store-room, the potatoes
and vegetables in the suller. (Stops talking to give him three or four full
smiles). The mop is hangin&#8217; up behind the back door, the stove brush
and blackin&#8217; in the suller-way, and the lamp-chimney cleaner is hangin&#8217;
over the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>(Josiah had stood as if dumb foundered, now he yelled as he
straightened up.) Dum it all! What are <i>you</i> goin&#8217; to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to charm and allure you, dear Josiah; wimmen
are made to charm men, they should do nothin&#8217; important.</p>

<p>(Josiah drops into a chair, his arms hanging down at his side in
a despairing way and stares at her.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> A clean house is important, therefore I will not clean.
Eatin&#8217; is important therefore I will not cook, I will emulate the rose in
its wisdom, I will charm and be silent. (She leans back in a luxurious
attitude and smiles a good deal at him).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Rising). Are you a consarned lunatick? Or what duz
ail you? (Puts on his glasses and looks closely at her. His angry
looks changes to one of deep anxiety and alarm. With his eye on her
all the time he edges off and reaches for the camphor bottle on a mantle
in the kitchen, takes it in one hand and then reaches for the soap stone
on the kitchen stove and carries it back in a scared fashion. He asks
low and appealingly). Don&#8217;t you want your back rubbed, Samantha?
Where is your worst pain? (He lays down the soap stun within easy
reach on the table and steps cautiously near). Won&#8217;t camfire relieve
you? Shall I go after Miss Gowdey or the doctor? (Steps to one side
and looks round as if uncertain what to do). Don&#8217;t you want your feet
soaked? (Glancin&#8217; towards the kitchen).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Straightens up). Josiah Allen, I don&#8217;t want soap
stuns or camfire, I want reason and common sense in a pardner, that&#8217;s
what I want to relieve me. I have tried faithful to foller the rules you
read this mornin&#8217;. You said you loved the man that wrote &#8217;em and
if I would only foller &#8217;em you would be the happiest man in Jonesville
or the world. I have follered &#8217;em for about twenty minutes and it has
reduced you to the condition of a lunatick. If twenty minutes has brung
you to this state, what would hours and days of it do and years? Now
it has made you lose your morals, tear round, use wicked language,
break your word to your grocer, and <i>act</i>. Now if you have had
enough of allurin&#8217; and charmin&#8217; say so and I&#8217;ll stop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Moved uneasily around while she was speaking and then
said). Oh dum the piece! and dum the feller that wrote it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Leans back, clasps her hands and smiles, Josiah
stamps on the floor and kicks, Samantha smiles sweetly and murmurs).
Sweet, darling he-angel!</p>

<p>(Josiah runs his fingers through his hair till it stands on end,
stamps, kicks the boot-jack across the floor and loosens a panel in the
clothes press door. His anger seems to have spent itself in this, for he
turns to her and says mournfully). I haven&#8217;t had a mouful to eat for
forty-eight hours. (Putting his hand to his head as if in despair for
a minute or two, then lifting his head he says). Dear Samantha, I&#8217;ve
had enough of the Rose Act, and I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to have you vote, I want
you to, I&#8217;ll carry you to the pole myself and swear you in if I go to jail
the next minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (Getting up and going towards the kitchen). Be megum,
Josiah, don&#8217;t go too fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> I tell you Samantha, I&#8217;ve had enough allurin&#8217; and charmin&#8217;
to last me through a long life, now I want some meat vittles, and I
want &#8217;em quick!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">ACT III.</h2></div>


<p>(A pleasant sitting room, lamps lighted for evening. Samantha
dressed in brown alpaca, with a book in her hand sits in an easy chair
and says to herself).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> Josiah sot off in good season after all for Jonesville,
and at his request I went with him, and on the way we visited very
agreeable. He wuz extremely affectionate, caused partly by his feelings,
for he worships me, and partly by his dinner, for it wuz as good
a dinner as hands ever got. I briled the young tender fowl I had already
dressed, smashed up the potatoes with plenty of cream and butter
in &#8217;em, made an orange puddin&#8217; so delicious it would fairly melt in
your mouth, and some fragrant coffee so rich and yaller with cream it
would do anyone&#8217;s soul good to drink it, and while I wuz gittin&#8217; dinner,
such is my faculty for turnin&#8217; off work, I finished that butter, and
immegiately after dinner packed it, put a snow-white cloth over it, and
we sot off in good season after all for Jonesville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Enters room, hangs up coat and hat and takes a comfortable
chair, leans back looking very good natured, and says as he
looks at Samantha and hitches his chair nearer to her). That sweet
flowery talk I read this mornin&#8217; is a comfort to men to write, and makes
&#8217;em feel good natured and patronizin&#8217; towards wimmen. But come to
crumple right down to real life that Rose Act wouldn&#8217;t work worth a
cent, and if it did, men would git sick of it, sick as a dog. (He draws
his chair still nearer to Samantha).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> And I felt like a fool sittin&#8217; there tryin&#8217; to allure and
charm, smilin&#8217; stiddy when I knew everything wuz at loose ends in the
kitchen. I wuz as happy agin when I wuz getting your dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Heartily and loudly). So wuz I, Samantha, heaven
knows, I wuz as happy as a king when you wuz gittin&#8217; it, and happier
than any king ever wuz when I wuz eatin&#8217; it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> I don&#8217;t know when I am happier than when I am makin&#8217;
my home comfortable and agreeable, gittin&#8217; a good warm supper for
you when I know you are comin&#8217; home tired and cold and hungry at
night-fall. Goin&#8217; round reasonable and calm in a clean kitchen, brilin&#8217;
a plump fowl or cookin&#8217; oysters and cream biscuits, and coffee or
sunthin&#8217; else you like, settin&#8217; the snowy table and keepin a bright fire
blazin&#8217; on a clean hearth, waitin&#8217; for the man I love. (Enthusiastically
as she steps to the table for her knitting). I am as happy again and
any woman would be as happy again as she would be tryin&#8217; to do that
Rose Act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Earnestly). Yes, that is so, Samantha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> I tell you, Josiah, that wimmen that don&#8217;t keep a
hired girl and have to bring up five or six children by hand, besides
doin&#8217; all the housework, washin&#8217; and ironin&#8217;, sewin&#8217;, skimmin&#8217; milk and
makin&#8217; butter and cleanin&#8217; house and settin&#8217; hens and feedin&#8217; chickens
and makin&#8217; rag carpets and quiltin&#8217; bed-quilts and knittin&#8217; stockin&#8217;s
and pickin&#8217; geese and dryin&#8217; apples and makin&#8217; soap and paperin&#8217; walls
and paintin&#8217; doorsteps and tendin&#8217; flower gardens and weedin&#8217; onions
and etcetery, they have to do some important work, they cannot set
still and allure and charm, not for any length of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> That&#8217;s so, Samantha, it hadn&#8217;t ort to be expected of a
poor woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> (With knitting in her lap and spec&#8217;s pushed up). No,
Josiah, nor from rich wimmen either that have to wait on three or four
hired girls, and have big houses in country and city, and tend big
parties and give &#8217;em, and go out drivin&#8217; every day and to the opera, and
theatres, and to Eourope every now and then and to the sea-shore and
mountains, and south and east and west, and ride out in yots and ortos
and air-ships, and set on boards, charity and missionary and hospital
boards, every one on &#8217;em hard ones, and give balls and entertainments
for the same. And get their children headed right in morals and education
and society. And stand up hour after hour to be fitted for
mornin&#8217; gowns and evenin&#8217; gowns and tea-gowns and dinner gowns and
fussin&#8217; with cameras and pianolas and lectures on every subject under
heaven. And their work amongst the poor, and makin&#8217; more than a
thousand calls and receivin&#8217; the same. Good land! what time do they
have for the Rose Act?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> They don&#8217;t have any time for it, I always said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> And won&#8217;t you own up, Josiah, that rich wimmen and
poor wimmen do harder work than to drop a little slip of paper onto
the pole once or twice a year?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Looking very good natured). Yes, Samantha, we men
know that hain&#8217;t no harder on &#8217;em than mailin&#8217; a letter. If I dast, I&#8217;d
tell you the real reason why we male statesmen oppose wimmins&#8217; votin&#8217;,
but I dassen&#8217;t tell, it is a state secret, jealously guarded by us male
law-makers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samantha.</span> I wish you would tell me, Josiah. Men&#8217;s talk on this
subject is so strange and queer I&#8217;d love to know the real truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Firmly). And I&#8217;d love to tell you, Samantha, but I dassen&#8217;t.
We male men have guarded that political secret as we have the
very apples in our eyes. (Shaking his head solemnly). No, as much
store I set by you, Samantha, I don&#8217;t dast to tell you.</p>

<p>(Samantha sits thinking deeply with her fingers on her forehead,
then her face brightens up and she says gently). I thought, Josiah,
that mebby you&#8217;d like to have me put on the tea-kittle and git a little
lunch, we eat supper ruther early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> (Heartily). Yes, I <i>would</i> like it, one of your good lunches
would go to the spot, I guess I <i>will</i> tell you after all. But remember
it is in strict confidence. We male men oppose wimmens&#8217; votin&#8217; because
we want to keep the power in our own hands, and kinder boss
round, and we talk about the hardships of wimmens&#8217; votin&#8217; and call &#8217;em
angels and so on jest as the doctor gives morphine to his patients to

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
